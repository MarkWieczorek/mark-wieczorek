### About me ###

My scientific research focuses on deciphering the interior structure and geologic evolution of the terrestrial planets and moons. As a geophysicist, I mostly use planetary topography, gravity, and magnetic field data that have been acquired from orbiting spacecraft, but I also rely on remote sensing data, seismic data, thermal evolution modeling, and impact crater formation models. I have worked with several lunar missions, including NASA's lunar gravity mapping mission GRAIL, and the upcoming Lunar Vertex mission that will investigate one of the largest magnetic anomalies on the Moon. I am also a co-investigator on NASA's geophysical mission to Mars, Insight, the laser altimeters on ESA's BepiColombo mission to Mercury and the JUICE mission to Ganymede, and NASA's mission to the asteroid 16 Psyche.

I am currently at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, where I have been since 2023. Prior to this I was at the *Observatoire de la CÃ´te d'Azur* as a member of the *Laboratoire Lagrange* (2017-2022), and before this I was the leader of the Planetary and Space Sciences group at IPGP. I was the editor-in-chief of the *Journal of Geophysical Research Planets* from 2011-2015 and I am currently a member of the *Icarus* editorial advory board. In addition to my scientific activities, I am the lead developer of the [shtools](https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/) software package that is used for analyzing global data expressed in spherical harmonics.
