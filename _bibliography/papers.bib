	abstract = {A new method of interpreting geoid to topographry ratios (GTRs) on a sphere is presented, in which it is shown that the GTR is equivalent to a sum of spectrally weighted degree-dependent admittance. Using this method combined with newly obtained gravity, topography, and near-global surface iron concentrations from the Clementine mission, the structure and compensation of the lunar highland crust have been investigated. Geoid to topography ratios were tested against single-layer Pratt and Airy compensation models, as well as dual-layered Airy models. Regional lateral variations in crustal density are found to play an insignificant role in crustal compensation, and the single-layer and dual-layered Airy models both strongly suggest that the lunar crust is vertically stratified. The depth of the intracrustal interface obtained from these models is consistent with the existence of a 20-km seismic discontinuity beneath the Apollo 12 and 14 sites. A uniform density crust with compensation occurring at the Moho is a viable interpretation of crustal structure only when the extreme limits of the observed GTR distribution are used.},

              The origin of lunar mass concentrations (or mascons), which appear as prominent bull's-eye patterns on gravitational maps of both the near- and far side of the Moon, has been a mystery since they were originally detected in 1968. Using state-of-the-art simulation codes,

            High-resolution gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory spacecraft have clarified the origin of lunar mass concentrations (mascons). Free-air gravity anomalies over lunar impact basins display bull’s-eye patterns consisting of a central positive (mascon) anomaly, a surrounding negative collar, and a positive outer annulus. We show that this pattern results from impact basin excavation and collapse followed by isostatic adjustment and cooling and contraction of a voluminous melt pool. We used a hydrocode to simulate the impact and a self-consistent finite-element model to simulate the subsequent viscoelastic relaxation and cooling. The primary parameters controlling the modeled gravity signatures of mascon basins are the impactor energy, the lunar thermal gradient at the time of impact, the crustal thickness, and the extent of volcanic fill.},

Such a basis of simultaneously spatially and spectrally concentrated functions should be a useful data analysis and representation tool in a variety of geophysical and planetary applications, as well as in medical imaging, computer science, cosmology, and numerical analysis. The spherical Slepian functions can be found by solving either an algebraic eigenvalue problem in the spectral domain or a Fredholm integral equation in the spatial domain. The associated eigenvalues are a measure of the spatiospectral concentration. When the concentration region is an axisymmetric polar cap, the spatiospectral projection operator commutes with a Sturm–Liouville operator; this enables the eigenfunctions to be computed extremely accurately and eﬃciently, even when their area-bandwidth product, or Shannon number, is large. In the asymptotic limit of a small spatial region and a large spherical harmonic bandwidth, the spherical concentration problem reduces to its planar equivalent, which exhibits self-similarity when the Shannon number is kept invariant.},

In this study, we estimate the magnitude of surface heat ﬂux heterogeneities in order to assess how the heat ﬂux at the InSight landing site relates to the average heat ﬂux of Mars. To this end, we model the thermal evolution of Mars in a 3-D spherical geometry and investigate the resulting surface spatial variations of heat ﬂux at the present day. Our models assume a ﬁxed crust with a variable thickness as inferred from gravity and topography data and with radiogenic heat sources as obtained from gamma ray measurements of the surface. We test several mantle parameters and show that the present-day surface heat ﬂux pattern is dominated by the imposed crustal structure. The largest surface heat ﬂux peak-to peak variations lie between 17.2 and 49.9 mW m−2, with the highest values being associated with the occurrence of prominent mantle plumes. However, strong spatial variations introduced by such plumes remain narrowly conﬁned to a few geographical regions and are unlikely to bias the InSight heat ﬂux measurement. We estimated that the average surface heat ﬂux varies between 23.2 and 27.3 mW m−2, while at the InSight location it lies between 18.8 and 24.2 mW m−2. In most models, elastic lithosphere thickness values exceed 250 km at the north pole, while the south pole values lie well above 110 km.},

	abstract = {Most recent methods in ionospheric tomography are based on the inversion of the total electron content measured by ground-based GPS receivers. As a consequence of the high frequency of the GPS signal and the absence of horizontal raypaths, the electron density structure is mainly reconstructed in the F2 region (300 km), where the ionosphere reaches the maximum of ionization, and is not sensitive to the lower ionospheric structure. We propose here a new tomographic method of the lower ionosphere, based on the full inversion of over-the-horizon (OTH) radar data. Previous studies using OTH radar for ionospheric tomography inverted only the leading edge echo curve of backscatter ionograms. The major advantage of our methodology is taking into account, numerically and jointly, the eﬀect that the electron density perturbations induce not only in the speed of electromagnetic waves but also on the raypath geometry. This last point is extremely critical for OTH radar inversions as the emitted signal propagates through the ionosphere between a ﬁxed starting point (the radar) and an unknown end point on the Earth surface where the signal is backscattered. We detail our ionospheric tomography method with the aid of benchmark tests. Having proved the necessity to take into account both eﬀects simultaneously, we apply our method to real data. This is the ﬁrst time that the eﬀect of the raypath deﬂection has been quantiﬁed and that the ionospheric plasma density has been estimated over the entirety of Europe with an OTH radar.},

These models require a core radius strictly larger than 1,800 km, a crust with an average thickness between 48.8 and 87.1 km containing more than half of the planet’s bulk abundance of heat producing elements, and a dry mantle rheology. A strong pressure dependence of the viscosity leads to the formation of prominent mantle plumes producing melt underneath Tharsis up to the present time.

Previous estimates of the Moon fall into two distinct groups: earthlike and a 50% enrichment in the Moon compared with the Earth. Revised crustal thicknesses and compositional information from remote sensing and lunar samples indicate that the crust contributes 1.13–1.85 wt% Al203 to the bulk Moon abundance. Mare basalt Al203 concentrations (8–10 wt%) and Al203 partitioning behaviour between melt and pyroxene during partial melting indicate mantle Al203
concentration in the range 1.3–3.1 wt%, depending on the relative amounts of pyroxene and olivine. Using crustal and mantle mass fractions, we show that that the Moon and the Earth most likely have the same (within 20%) concentrations of refractory elements. This allows us to use correlations between pairs of refractory and volatile elements to confirm that lunar abundances of moderately volatile elements such as K, Rb and Cs are depleted by 75% in the Moon compared with the Earth and that highly volatile elements, such as Tl and Cd, are depleted by 99%. The earthlike refractory abundances and depleted volatile abundances are strong constraints on lunar formation processes.},

	abstract = {Detailed mapping of topography is crucial for the understanding of processes shaping the surfaces of planetary bodies. In particular, stereoscopic imagery makes a major contribution to topographic mapping and especially supports the geologic characterization of planetary surfaces. Image data provide the basis for extensive studies of the surface structure and morphology on local, regional and global scales using photogeologic information from images, the topographic information from stereo-derived digital terrain models and co-registered spectral terrain information from color images. The objective of the Psyche topography and geomorphology investigation is to derive the detailed shape of (16) Psyche to generate orthorectiﬁed image mosaics, which are needed to study the asteroids’ landforms, interior structure, and the processes that have modiﬁed the surface over geologic time. In this paper we describe our approaches for producing shape models, and our plans for acquiring requested image data to quantify the expected accuracy of the results. Multi-angle images obtained by Psyche’s camera will be used to create topographic models with about 15 m/pixel horizontal resolution and better than 10 m height accuracy on a global scale. This is slightly better as global imaging obtained during the Dawn mission, however, both missions yield resolutions of a few m/pixel locally. Two different techniques, stereophotogrammetry and stereophotoclinometry, are used to model the shape; these models will be merged with the gravity ﬁelds obtained by the Psyche spacecraft to produce geodetically controlled topographic models. The resulting digital topography models, together with the gravity data, will reveal the tectonic, volcanic, impact, and gradational history of Psyche, and enable co-registration of data sets to determine Psyche’s geologic history.},

	abstract = {Some years ago, the consensus was that asteroid (16) Psyche was almost entirely metal. New data on density, radar properties, and spectral signatures indicate that the asteroid is something perhaps even more enigmatic: a mixed metal and silicate world. Here we combine observations of Psyche with data from meteorites and models for planetesimal formation to produce the best current hypotheses for Psyche's properties and provenance. Psyche's bulk density appears to be between 3,400 and 4,100 kg m−3. Psyche is thus predicted to have between {\textasciitilde}30 and {\textasciitilde}60 vol\% metal, with the remainder likely low‐iron silicate rock and not more than {\textasciitilde}20\% porosity. Though their density is similar, mesosiderites are an unlikely analog to bulk Psyche because mesosiderites have far more iron‐rich silicates than Psyche appears to have. CB chondrites match both Psyche's density and spectral properties, as can some pallasites, although typical pallasitic olivine contains too much iron to be consistent with the reﬂectance spectra. Final answers, as well as resolution of contradictions in the data set of Psyche physical properties, for example, the thermal inertia measurements, may not be resolved until the NASA Psyche mission arrives in orbit at the asteroid. Despite the range of compositions and formation processes for Psyche allowed by the current data, the science payload of the Psyche mission (magnetometers, multispectral imagers, neutron spectrometer, and a gamma‐ray spectrometer) will produce data sets that distinguish among the models. Plain Language Summary Since the NASA mission to asteroid (16) Psyche was selected, interest from the public and from the scientiﬁc community in the asteroid has risen considerably. New observations of the asteroid's physical properties indicate a different composition than earlier data had shown. A decade ago, much of the community thought the asteroid was 90\% metal on its surface. There are still contradictions in the compilation of all current data, but the best analysis indicates that Psyche's density is between 3,400 and 4,100 kg m−3, indicating it is a mixture of rock with between 30 and 60 vol\% metal.},

	abstract = {The shape and internal structure of an asteroid is a result of its violent collisional history, and Asteroid 25143 Itokawa is an important target for investigating the internal structure and formation processes associated with rubble pile asteroids. The surface of Itokawa contains numerous boulders and is very rough, but 20\% of the surface is covered with centimeter-sized gravels that are called ”smooth terrain”. These ﬂat areas are associated with low areas of the gravitational potential and are considered to be formed by down-slope migration and accumulation of pebbles. We propose a method to constrain the interior density distribution of an asteroid by modeling the gravity ﬁeld and ﬁtting the smooth terrains to equi-potential surfaces. Density models that are composed of two distinct lobes best explain the data if the ”head” and ”body” have different densities of 2,450 kg/ m3 and 1,930 kg/m3, respectively. Alternatively, the two lobes could have comparable densities if there was a compressed ”neck” of higher density between the two. Three layer models that treat the densities of the head, neck and body separately are largely unconstrained. However, when using an independent estimate of the centerof-mass/center-of-ﬁgure offset as determined from modeling the YORP spin-up of Itokawa, our models require the density of the head to be larger than the global average.},

For an Airy model for isostatic compensation of variations in topography, we infer an average crustal thickness of 35 ± 18 km. Combined with the value of the radius of the core of Mercury, this crustal thickness implies that Mercury had the highest eﬃciency of crustal production among the terrestrial planets. From the measured abundance of heat-producing elements on the surface, we calculate that the heat production in the mantle from long-lived radioactive elements at 4.45 Ga was greater than 5.4 × 10−12 W/kg. By analogy with the Moon, the relatively thin crust of Mercury allows for the possibility that major impact events, such as the one that formed the Caloris basin, excavated material from Mercury’s mantle.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that mare basalts on the Moon are preferentially located both on the Earth-facing hemisphere and within large impact basins. A popular model that accounts for this observation assumes that these magmas were denser than the lunar crust, that they accumulated at the crust{\textasciicircum}mantle interface, and that eruptions occurred only when this magma chamber became overpressurized. In this paper, we re-evaluate this model and argue that it is not consistent with the available data nor with models of dike propagation. As an alternative hypothesis, we propose that magma buoyancy is the predominant factor that determines whether mare basalts erupt at the surface or form crustal intrusions instead. We have computed the densities of mare basaltic magmas and find that some are, in fact, less dense than the Moon's upper anorthositic crust. Based on the widely accepted view that the lunar crust becomes more mafic with depth, we also show that all mare basaltic magmas should be less dense than the lower portion of the crust. Thus, if the upper anorthositic crust was regionally removed by an impact event, then any mare basaltic magma could have risen to the surface there based on buoyancy considerations alone. In support of this model, we note that mare basalts are indeed found wherever geophysical crustal thickness models predict the upper crust to be absent. Furthermore, many of the basalts that erupted within the anorthositic highlands are predicted to be less dense than the underlying crust based on remote sensing data. The high titanium flows within Oceanus Procellarum are somewhat problematical to our model in that an anorthositic crust is predicted to be present beneath them. Using results from recent lunar thermal models, we suggest that these magmas may have overcome their negative buoyancy in the crust by possessing superliquidus temperatures. If magma buoyancy does indeed control whether or not a basaltic eruption will occur, then this implies that the quantity of magma produced beneath the South Pole-Aitken basin was about 10 times less than that of the nearside. ß 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using a localized multitaper spherical-harmonic analysis, an eﬀective density spectrum is calculated that provides an estimate of the average crustal density as a function of spherical harmonic degree. By comparing the observed eﬀective density spectrum with one generated from a theoretical model, the thickness of mare basalts can be constrained. We assume that the grain density of the basalts is known from remote sensing data and petrologic considerations, we assign a constant porosity to the basalts, and we let both the thickness of the basalts and the density of the underlying crust vary. Using this method, the total thickness of basalts was estimated on the nearside hemisphere, yielding an average of 0.74 km with 1𝜎 upper and lower bounds of 1.62 km and 100 m, respectively. The region of Marius Hills, which is a long-lived volcanic complex, is found to have the thickest basalts, with an average of 2.86 km and 1𝜎 limits of 3.65 and 1.02 km, respectively. The crust beneath the Mare Imbrium basalts is found to have an atypically high density of about 3000 kg m−3 that we interpret as representing a maﬁc, unfractured, impact melt sheet.},

	abstract = {Partially buried craters on the Moon are those craters whose distal ejecta are covered by lava flows and where the crater rim crest still protrudes above the mare plain. Based on the difference in rim heights between a partially buried crater and an unburied crater, previous studies estimated the thicknesses of the lunar mare basalts. However, these studies did not consider the erosion of the crater rim height, which can result in an overestimate in the derived thickness. By using recent high-resolution topographic data, we report a basalt thickness estimation method based on numerically modeling the topographic degradation of partially buried craters. We identified 661 buried craters over the lunar surface, and their spatial distribution suggests a preferential occurrence along the mare-highland boundaries. An elevation model of fresh lunar craters was derived, and the topographic diffusion equation was used to model crater degradation. By modeling the formation, degradation, and flooding of partially buried craters, basalt thicknesses were estimated for 41 mare craters whose rims are completely exposed. The resulting mare basalt thicknesses vary from 33 to 455 m, with a median value of 105 m that is 95 m smaller than that derived when not considering crater degradation. The estimated eruption rate of lunar mare basalts is found to have peaked at 3.4 Ga and then decreased with time, indicating a progressive cooling of the lunar interior. As a by-product from the crater degradation model, our results suggest that the topographic diffusivity of lunar craters increases with diameter.},

With topographic data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter and gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory, we investigate support of highland topography. Poor correlation between crustal density and elevation shows that Pratt compensation is not important in the highlands. Using spectrally weighted admittance, we compared observed values of geoid-to-topography ratio (GTR) with those predicted by isostatic models. Observed GTRs are 25.8+–57..75 m/km for the nearside highlands and 39.3+–65..27 m/km for the farside highlands. These values are not consistent with ﬂexural compensation of long-wavelength topography or Airy isostasy deﬁned under an assumption of equal mass in crustal columns. Instead, the observed GTR values are consistent with models of Airy compensation in which isostasy is deﬁned under a requirement of equal pressures at equipotential surfaces at depth. The gravity and topography data thus reveal that long-wavelength topography on the Moon is most likely compensated by variations in crustal thickness, implying that highland topography formed early in lunar history before the development of a thick elastic lithosphere.},

	abstract = {We present our latest high-resolution lunar gravity field model of degree and order 1200 in spherical harmonics using Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) data. In addition to a model with the standard spectral Kaula regularization constraint, we determine models by applying a constraint based on topography called rank-minus-one (RM1). The new models using this RM1 constraint have high correlations with topography over the entire degree range by design. The RM1 models allow the determination of apparent crustal densities at all spatial scales (called effective density) covered by the model, whereas the Kaula-constrained model can only be used globally up to spherical harmonic degree 700. We find that the effective density spectrum has a smaller slope for the high degrees when compared to the medium degrees. We interpret this as indicative of a global average surface density, as opposed to an ever-decreasing effective density as one approaches the surface. We use the RM1 models to derive maps of lateral and vertical density variations in the lunar crust. These models allow us to increase the resolution of this analysis compared to previous studies, by increasing the degree range over which to fit theoretical models of vertical density variations, and by decreasing the size of the spherical caps used in a localized analysis. Several regions on the Moon, such as South Pole-Aitken and Mare Orientale, are distinct from their surroundings in terms of surface densities. The RM1 models are especially valuable in (localized) spectral studies of the structure of the lunar crust.},

	abstract = {Crustal plateaus are Venusian highlands characterized by tectonized terrains. It is commonly interpreted that their topography is isostatically supported and that they represent fossils of an extinct tectonic regime. Using gravity and topography we perform a comprehensive investigation of the lithospheric structure of six crustal plateaus. We computed the admittance (gravity to topography wavelength-dependent ratio) for each region and compared them to modeled admittances. Three compensation scenarios were tested: Airy isostasy, a surface-loading flexural model, and a flexural model with surface and subsurface loads. Our results show that the topography of most plateaus is supported by crustal thickening and that the addition of a mantle support component is not necessary at the investigated wavelengths. The elastic thickness was constrained to be less than 35 km with a best-fitting average of 15 km, confirming that these regions are consistent with an isostatic regime. The average crustal thickness of the plateaus ranges from 15 to 34 km, and if they are in Airy isostasy, this implies that the global average crustal thickness of Venus is about 20 km. Phoebe Regio is the sole exception of our analysis in that crustal thicknesses that are compatible with the other plateaus are obtained only when a buoyant layer is included. Heat flow estimations computed from the elastic thickness indicate that the plateaus formed under higher heat flow conditions compared to the current global average and could have caused localized melting. Present-day heat flow predictions suggest that eclogitization could occur where the crust is thickest.},

	abstract = {Positive free-air gravity anomalies associated with large lunar impact basins represent a superisostatic mass concentration or “mascon.” High-resolution lunar gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory spacecraft reveal that these mascons are part of a bulls-eye pattern in which the central positive anomaly is surrounded by an annulus of negative anomalies, which in turn is surrounded by an outer annulus of positive anomalies. To understand the origin of this gravity pattern, we modeled numerically the entire evolution of basin formation from impact to contemporary form. With a hydrocode, we simulated impact excavation and collapse and show that during the major basin-forming era, the preimpact crust and mantle were sufﬁciently weak to enable a crustal cap to ﬂow back over and cover the mantle exposed by the impact within hours. With hydrocode results as initial conditions, we simulated subsequent cooling and viscoelastic relaxation of topography using a ﬁnite element model, focusing on the mare-free Freundlich-Sharonov and mare-inﬁlled Humorum basins. By constraining these models with measured free-air and Bouguer gravity anomalies as well as surface topography, we show that lunar basins evolve by isostatic adjustment from an initially subisostatic state following the collapse stage. The key to the development of a superisostatic inner basin center is its mechanical coupling to the outer basin that rises in response to subisostatic stresses, enabling the inner basin to rise above isostatic equilibrium. Our calculations relate basin size to impactor diameter and velocity, and they constrain the preimpact lunar thermal structure, crustal thickness, viscoelastic rheology, and, for the Humorum basin, the thickness of its postimpact mare ﬁll.},

            The lunar cratering record is used to constrain the bombardment history of both the Earth and the Moon. However, it is suggested from different perspectives, including impact crater dating, asteroid dynamics, lunar samples, impact basin-forming simulations, and lunar evolution modelling, that the Moon could be missing evidence of its earliest cratering record. Here we report that impact basins formed during the lunar magma ocean solidification should have produced different crater morphologies in comparison to later epochs. A low viscosity layer, mimicking a melt layer, between the crust and mantle could cause the entire impact basin size range to be susceptible to immediate and extreme crustal relaxation forming almost unidentifiable topographic and crustal thickness signatures. Lunar basins formed while the lunar magma ocean was still solidifying may escape detection, which is agreeing with studies that suggest a higher impact flux than previously thought in the earliest epoch of Earth-Moon evolution.},

The Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission mapped the gravity ﬁeld of these impact structures at signiﬁcantly higher spatial resolution than previous missions, allowing for detailed subsurface and morphological analyses to be made across the entire globe. GRAIL-derived crustal thickness maps were used to deﬁne the regions of crustal thinning observed in centers of lunar impact basins, which represents a less unambiguous measure of a basin size than those based on topographic features. The formation of lunar impact basins was modeled numerically by using the iSALE-2D hydrocode, with a large range of impact and target conditions typical for the ﬁrst billion years of lunar evolution. In the investigated range of impactor and target conditions, the target temperature had the dominant effect on the basin subsurface morphology. Model results were also used to update current impact scaling relationships applicable to the lunar setting (based on assumed target temperature). Our new temperature-dependent impact-scaling relationships provide estimates of impact conditions and transient crater diameters for the majority of impact basins mapped by GRAIL. As the formation of lunar impact basins is associated with the ﬁrst {\textasciitilde}700 Myr of the solar system evolution when the impact ﬂux was considerably larger than the present day, our revised impact scaling relationships can aid further analyses and understanding of the extent of impact bombardment on the Moon and terrestrial planets in the early solar system.},

	abstract = {The inversion of regolith thickness over the nearside hemisphere of the Moon from newly acquired Earthbased 70-cm Arecibo radar data is investigated using a quantitative radar scattering model. The radar scattering model takes into account scattering from both the lunar surface and buried rocks in the lunar regolith, and three parameters are critically important in predicting the radar backscattering coefﬁcient: the dielectric constant of the lunar regolith, the surface roughness, and the size and abundance of subsurface rocks. The measured dielectric properties of the Apollo regolith samples at 450 MHz are re-analyzed, and an improved relation among the complex dielectric constant, bulk density and regolith composition is obtained. The complex dielectric constant of the lunar regolith is estimated globally from this relation using the regolith composition derived from Lunar Prospector gamma-ray spectrometer data. To constrain the lunar surface roughness and abundance of subsurface rocks from radar data, nine regions are selected as calibration sites where the regolith thickness has been estimated using independent analysis techniques. For these sites, scattering from the lunar surface and buried rocks cannot be perfectly distinguished, and a tradeoff relationship exists between the size and abundance of buried rocks and surface roughness. Using these tradeoff relations as guidelines for globally representative parameters, the regolith thickness of four regions over the lunar nearside is inverted, and the inversion uncertainties caused by calibration errors of the radar data and model input parameters are analyzed. The regolith thickness of the maria is generally smaller than that of highlands, and older surfaces have thicker regolith thicknesses. Our approach cannot be applied to regions where the surface roughness is very high, such as with young rocky craters and regions in the highly rugged highlands.},

	abstract = {Spacecraft observations show that weak magnetic ﬁelds of crustal origin are ubiquitous across the surface of the Moon. To investigate the origin of these magnetic anomalies, a model was developed for the magnetic power spectrum that consists of ensembles of randomly magnetized sills or prisms. Localized spectrum analyses constrained how the parameters of this model vary with position, including the size of the sources, a quantity proportional to their mean-squared dipole moment, and the depth to the top and bottom of the magnetized region. The depth to the top of the magnetized region varies from the surface to about 25 km. The magnetic carriers in the deep crust likely formed at the same time as the crust itself, implying that a core-generated dynamo ﬁeld must have existed when the crust was cooling during the ﬁrst 100 Myr of lunar evolution. The parameter related to the strength of magnetization shows the existence of a prominent region on the nearside hemisphere that is largely unmagnetized and that correlates with a region of extremely low surface ﬁeld strengths. This region lies entirely within a geological province that is highly enriched in heat-producing elements (the Procellarum KREEP Terrane), suggesting that this region escaped being magnetized because of prolonged high crustal temperatures. The nearside magnetic low may be representative of the size of that portion of the crust that is highly enriched in heat-producing elements, which is almost one third the size of the Procellarum KREEP Terrane based on surface thorium abundances.},

If the magnetic anomaly were related to iron-rich impact ejecta, there might also be a correlation between the magnetic field and topography. We use magnetic field, topography, and gravity data to test whether such correlations exist. Our results demonstrate that some magnetic anomalies show statistically significant positive correlations with free-air gravity and topography, and the magnetic sources within these regions could potentially be iron-rich impact ejecta. In a few cases, the magnetic anomalies show statistically significant positive correlations with Bouguer gravity, implying that the magnetic anomalies are associated with density anomalies within either the crust or upper mantle.

Models that use Lunar Prospector gamma-ray spectrometer values of thorium throughout the highland crust cannot sustain long lasting volcanic activity, as low abundances of heat-producing elements are left in the mantle to keep an Earth-like bulk silicate composition. The low magnetic ﬁeld intensities of the innermost Procellarum KREEP Terrane are consistent with a higher heat production than in the outermost portion and delayed cooling below the Curie temperature of iron metal until after 3.56 Ga when the dynamo ﬁeld strength is known to have decreased by an order of magnitude. The distribution of crustal heat sources also inﬂuences the depth evolution of isotopic closure isotherms for a range of isotopic systems relevant to radiometric dating, which may be important for sample age estimation. Core crystallization can sustain a continuous dynamo for about 1 billion years, after which dynamo activity is potentially more episodic.},

Modelling of the X-ray spectra with an abundance algorithm allows quantitative estimates of the MgO/SiO2 and Al2O3/SiO2 ratios to be made for the two regions, which are in mainly basaltic areas of the lunar nearside. One of these ground tracks includes the Apollo 14 landing site on the Fra Mauro Formation. Within the 1s errors provided, the results are inside the range of basaltic samples from the Apollo and Luna collections. The Apollo 14 soil composition is in agreement with the results from the January ﬂare at the 1s uncertainty level. Discrepancies are observed between our results and compositions derived for the same areas by the Lunar Prospector gamma-ray spectrometer; some possible reasons for this are discussed.},

In this paper, we present the surface abundances of Mg, Al, Si, Ca and Fe, derived from C1XS data for a highland region on the southern nearside of the Moon. Analysis techniques are described in detail including absolute X-ray line ﬂux derivation and conversion into elemental abundance.

	abstract = {The lunar geological record has much to tell us about the earliest history of the Solar System, the origin and evolution of the Earth–Moon system, the geological evolution of rocky planets, and the near-Earth cosmic environment throughout Solar System history. In addition, the lunar surface offers outstanding opportunities for research in astronomy, astrobiology, fundamental physics, life sciences and human physiology and medicine. This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of outstanding lunar science objectives in all of these different areas. It is concluded that addressing them satisfactorily will require an end to the 40-year hiatus of lunar surface exploration, and the placing of new scientiﬁc instruments on, and the return of additional samples from, the surface of the Moon. Some of these objectives can be achieved robotically (e.g., through targeted sample return, the deployment of geophysical networks, and the placing of antennas on the lunar surface to form radio telescopes). However, in the longer term, most of these scientiﬁc objectives would beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from renewed human operations on the lunar surface. For these reasons it is highly desirable that current plans for renewed robotic surface exploration of the Moon are developed in the context of a future human lunar exploration programme, such as that proposed by the recently formulated Global Exploration Roadmap.},

Using the iSALE-2D hydrocode to model impact basin formation, we found that impacts on the hotter nearside would have formed basins with up to twice the diameter of similar impacts on the cooler farside hemisphere. The size distribution of lunar impact basins is thus not representative of the earliest inner solar system impact bombardment.},

            The Moon's gravity map shows that the crust is cut by extensive magmatic dikes, perhaps implying a period of early expansion.
          ,
            The earliest history of the Moon is poorly preserved in the surface geologic record due to the high flux of impactors, but aspects of that history may be preserved in subsurface structures. Application of gravity gradiometry to observations by the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission results in the identification of a population of linear gravity anomalies with lengths of hundreds of kilometers. Inversion of the gravity anomalies indicates elongated positive-density anomalies that are interpreted to be ancient vertical tabular intrusions or dikes formed by magmatism in combination with extension of the lithosphere. Crosscutting relationships support a pre-Nectarian to Nectarian age, preceding the end of the heavy bombardment of the Moon. The distribution, orientation, and dimensions of the intrusions indicate a globally isotropic extensional stress state arising from an increase in the Moon's radius by 0.6 to 4.9 kilometers early in lunar history, consistent with predictions of thermal models.},

              It has long been known that the lunar farside highlands constitute the highest region on the Moon.

                Garrick-Bethell
                et al.

              (p.
              949
              ) show that the topography and crustal thickness variations of this elevated region obey a single, simple mathematical function that overall describes one-quarter of the Moon. The key to explaining this find may lie with a similarity between the hot, ancient Moon and one of the icy moons of Jupiter, Europa. Like today's Europa, the Moon's crust once floated on a subsurface ocean, except that it was made of liquid rock, not water. The same tidal effect that operates on Europa's crust, caused by Jupiter's gravitational force, would have also operated on the early Moon because of Earth's influence, and would have produced a pattern of crustal thickness variations similar to that observed in the farside highlands.

          ,
            A mathematical analysis of the lunar farside highlands implicates the role of tidal processes in building the lunar crust.
          ,
            The formation of the lunar farside highlands has long been an open problem in lunar science. We show that much of the topography and crustal thickness in this terrain can be described by a degree-2 harmonic. No other portion of the Moon exhibits comparable degree-2 structure. The quantified structure of the farside highlands unites them with the nearside and suggests a relation between lunar crustal structure, nearside volcanism, and heat-producing elements. The farside topography cannot be explained by a frozen-in tidal bulge. However, the farside crustal thickness and the topography it produces may have been caused by spatial variations in tidal heating when the ancient crust was decoupled from the mantle by a liquid magma ocean, similar to Europa’s present ice shell.},

Several of the largest lunar impact basins could have temporarily unlocked the Moon from synchronous rotation, and after the re-establishment of this state the Moon would have been left in either its initial orientation, or one that was rotated 180◦ about its spin axis. We show that there is less than a 2\% probability that the oldest lunar impact basins are randomly distributed across the lunar surface. Furthermore, these basins are preferentially located near the Moon’s antapex of motion, and this conﬁguration has less than a 0.3\% probability of occurring by chance. We postulate that the current “near side” of the Moon was in fact its “far side” when the oldest basins formed. One basin with the required size and temporal characteristics to account for a 180◦ reorientation is the Smythii basin.},

	abstract = {A new method is presented for estimating crustal thickness from gravity and topography data on the Moon. By calculating analytically the exterior gravitational ﬁeld for a set of arbitrarily shaped polyhedra, relief along the crust–mantle interface can be inverted for that satisﬁes the observational constraints. As this method does not rely upon ﬁltering the Bouguer anomaly, which was required with previous inversions performed in the spherical-harmonic domain, and as the dramatic variations in spatial quality of the lunar gravity ﬁeld are taken into account, our crustal thickness model more faithfully represents the available data. Using our model results, we investigate various aspects of the prominent nearside impact basins. The crustal thickness in the central portion of the Orientale and Crisium basins is found to be close to zero, suggesting that these basins could have conceivably excavated into the lunar mantle. Furthermore, given our uncertain knowledge of the density of the crust and mantle, it is possible that the Humorum, Humboldtianum, Nectaris, and Smythii basins could have excavated all the way through the crust as well. The crustal structure for most of the young impact basins implies a depth/diameter ratio of about 0.08 for their excavation cavities. As noted in previous studies, however, the crustal structure of Imbrium and Serenitatis is anomalous, which is conceivably a result of enhanced rates of post-impact viscous relaxation caused by the proximity of these basins to the Procellarum KREEP Terrane. Impact basins older than Smythii show little or no evidence for crustal thinning, suggesting that these ancient basins were also affected by high rates of viscous relaxation resulting from higher crustal temperatures early in the Moon’s evolution. The lithosphere beneath many young basins is found to be supporting a downward directed force, even after the load associated with the mare basalts is removed, and this is plausibly attributed to superisostatic uplift of the crust–mantle interface. Those basins that are close to achieving a pre-mare isostatic state are generally found to reside within, or close to, the Procellarum KREEP Terrane.},

The bulk density of the upper few kilometers of the lunar crust is estimated by minimizing the correlation between the topography and Bouguer gravity at short wavelengths that are unaffected by lithospheric flexure. Porosity is then derived using estimates of the grain density obtained from remote sensing data of the surface composition. The near surface crust in proximity to many large basins is found to exhibit distinct radial porosity signatures. Low porosities are found in the basin centers within the peak ring, whereas high porosities are identified near and just exterior to the main rim. The larger basins exhibit a more pronounced porosity signature than the smaller basins. Though the number of basins investigated in this study is limited, younger basins appear to be associated with the largest amplitude variations in porosity.

	abstract = {The Moon is key to understanding both Earth and our Solar System in terms of planetary processes and has been a witness of the Solar System history for more than 4.5 Ga. Building on earlier telescopic observations, our knowledge about the Moon was transformed by the wealth of information provided by Apollo and other space missions. These demonstrated the value of the Moon for understanding the fundamental processes that drive planetary formation and evolution. The Moon was understood as an inert body with its geology mainly restricted to impact and volcanism with associated tectonics, and a relative simple composition. Unlike Earth, an absence of plate tectonics has preserved a well-deﬁned accretion and geological evolution record. However recent missions to the Moon show that this traditional view of the lunar surface is certainly an over simpliﬁcation. For example, although it has long been suspected that ice might be preserved in cold traps at the lunar poles, recent results also indicate the formation and retention of OHÀ and H2O outside of polar regions. These volatiles are likely to be formed as a result of hydration processes operating at the lunar surface including the production of H2O and OH by solar wind protons interacting with oxygen-rich rock surfaces produced during micrometeorite impact on lunar soil particles. Moreover, on the basis of Lunar Prospector gamma-ray data, the lunar crust and underlying mantle has been found to be divided into distinct terranes that possess unique geochemical, geophysical, and geological characteristics. The concentration of heat producing elements on the nearside hemisphere of the Moon in the Procellarum KREEP Terrane has apparently led to the nearside being more volcanically active than the farside. Recent dating of basalts has shown that lunar volcanism was active for almost 3 Ga, starting at about 3.9–4.0 Ga and ceasing at \$ 1.2 Ga. A recent re-processing of the seismic data supports the presence of a partially molten layer at the base of the mantle and shows not only the presence of a 330 km liquid core, but also a small solid inner core. Today, the Moon does not have a dynamo-generated magnetic ﬁeld like that of the Earth. However, remnant magnetization of the lunar crust and the paleomagnetic record of some lunar samples suggest that magnetization was acquired, possibly from an intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld caused by an early lunar core dynamo. In summary, the Moon is a complex differentiated planetary object and much remains to be explored and discovered, especially regarding the origin of the Moon, the history of the Earth–Moon system, and processes that have operated in the inner Solar System over the last 4.5 Ga. Returning to the Moon is therefore the critical next stepping-stone to further exploration and understanding of our planetary neighborhood.},

Our models show a difference between maximum and minimum S wave velocity of up to 10\% either below the crust, where thermal variations are largest, or at the depth of the olivine to wadsleyite phase transition, located at around 1,000–1,200 km depth. Models with thick lithospheres on average have weak low-velocity zones that extend deeper than 400 km and seismic velocity variations in the uppermost 400–600 km that closely follow the crustal thickness pattern. For these cases, the crust contains more than half of the total amount of heat-producing elements. Models with limited crustal heat production have thinner lithospheres and shallower but prominent low-velocity zones that are incompatible with Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) observations. Seismic events suggested to originate in Cerberus Fossae indicate the absence of S wave shadow zones in 25°–30° epicentral distance. This result is compatible with previous best fit models that require a large average lithospheric thickness and a crust containing more than half of the bulk amount of heat-producing elements to be compatible with geological and geophysical constraints. Ongoing and future InSight measurements that will determine the existence of a weak low-velocity zone will directly bear on the crustal heat production.},

These crustal thickness constraints are currently limited to beneath the lander that is located in the northern lowlands, and we use gravity and topography data to construct global crustal thickness models that satisfy the seismic data. These models consider a range of possible mantle and core density profiles, a range of crustal densities, a low-density surface layer, and the possibility that the crustal density of the northern lowlands is greater than that of the southern highlands. Using the preferred InSight three-layer seismic model of the crust, the average crustal thickness of the planet is found to lie between 30 and 72 km. Depending on the choice of the upper mantle density, the maximum permissible density of the northern lowlands and southern highlands crust is constrained to be between 2,850 and 3,100 kg m −3. These crustal densities are lower than typical Martian basaltic materials and are consistent with a crust that is on average more felsic than the materials found at the surface. We argue that a substantial portion of the crust of Mars is a primary crust that formed during the initial differentiation of the planet. Various hypotheses for the origin of the observed intracrustal seisimic layers are assessed, with our preferred interpretation including thick volcanic deposits, ejecta from the Utopia basin, porosity closure, and differentiation products of a Borealis impact melt sheet.},

              The gravity field of a planet provides a view of its interior and thermal history by revealing areas of different density.

            Spacecraft-to-spacecraft tracking observations from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) have been used to construct a gravitational field of the Moon to spherical harmonic degree and order 420. The GRAIL field reveals features not previously resolved, including tectonic structures, volcanic landforms, basin rings, crater central peaks, and numerous simple craters. From degrees 80 through 300, over 98\% of the gravitational signature is associated with topography, a result that reflects the preservation of crater relief in highly fractured crust. The remaining 2\% represents fine details of subsurface structure not previously resolved. GRAIL elucidates the role of impact bombardment in homogenizing the distribution of shallow density anomalies on terrestrial planetary bodies.},

Therefore, if a transition layer exists, it is more likely to have a rigidity similar to that of the mantle (∼70 GPa).

The map has characteristics similar to those of previous maps but better resolves the shapes and distribution of weaker anomalies. The strongest group of anomalies is located on the northwest side of the South Pole-Aitken basin approximately antipodal to the Imbrium basin. On the near side, both strong isolated anomalies and weaker elongated anomalies tend to lie along lines oriented radial to Imbrium. These include named anomalies such as Reiner Gamma, Hartwig, Descartes, Abel, and Airy. The statistical significance of this tendency for elongated anomalies is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Great circle paths determined by end points of elongated anomaly groups and the locations of five individual strong anomalies converge within the inner rim of Imbrium and intersect within the Imbrium antipode zone. Statistically significant evidence for similar alignments northwest of the Orientale basin is also found. The observed distribution of anomalies on the near side and the location of the strongest anomaly group antipodal to Imbrium are consistent with the hypothesis that iron from the Imbrium impactor was mixed into ejecta that was inhomogeneously deposited downrange in groups aligned radial to the basin and concentrated antipodal to the basin.},

It is found that, of 25 basins with upper preNectarian and younger ages, 18 contain mapped internal anomalies with amplitudes of at least 1 nT at 30 km altitude. Of these, five are most confidently judged to contain intrinsic anomalies (i.e., anomalies located within the inner basin rims and originating at the times of basin formation): Crisium, Humboldtianum, Mendel-Rydberg, Moscoviense, and Nectaris. Comparing the anomaly distributions with previous numerical simulations of the impact of iron-rich planetesimals to form a large (SPA-sized) basin, inferences are drawn about the likely trajectories of the impactors. Specifically, results suggest that impactor trajectories for these basins were within ∼45° of being vertical and tended to lie on average parallel to the lunar equatorial plane and the ecliptic plane. Inverse modeling of anomalies within these basins yields inferred directions of magnetization that are difficult to reconcile with the axial centered dipole hypothesis for the geometry of the internal lunar dynamo field: Paleomagnetic pole positions are widely scattered and, in agreement with a recent independent study, the two main anomalies within Crisium yield significantly different directions of magnetization.},

	abstract = {The first seismometer operating on the surface of another planet was deployed by the NASA InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission to Mars. It gives us an opportunity to investigate the seismicity of Mars, including any seismic activity caused by small meteorite bombardment. Detectability of impact generated seismic signals is closely related to the seismic efficiency, defined as the fraction of the impactor's kinetic energy transferred into the seismic energy in a target medium. This work investigated the seismic efficiency of the Martian near surface associated with small meteorite impacts on Mars. We used the iSALE-2D (Impact-Simplified Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian) shock physics code to simulate the formation of the meter-size impact craters, and we used a recently formed 1.5 m diameter crater as a case study. The Martian crust was simulated as unfractured nonporous bedrock, fractured bedrock with 25\% porosity, and highly porous regolith with 44\% and 65\% porosity. We used appropriate strength and porosity models defined in previous works, and we identified that the seismic efficiency is very sensitive to the speed of sound and elastic threshold in the target medium. We constrained the value of the impact-related seismic efficiency to be between the order of ∼10-7 to 10-6 for the regolith and ∼10-4 to 10-3 for the bedrock. For new impacts occurring on Mars, this work can help understand the near-surface properties of the Martian crust, and it contributes to the understanding of impact detectability via seismic signals as a function of the target media.},

	abstract = {The polar caps of Mars have long been acknowledged to be composed of unknown proportions of water ice, solid CO2 (dry ice), and dust. Gravity and topography data are here analyzed over the southern cap to place constraints on its density, and hence composition. Using a localized spectral analysis combined with a lithospheric ﬂexure model of ice cap loading, the best ﬁt density of the volatile-rich south polar layered deposits is found to be 1271 kg m−3 with 1-σ limits of 1166 and 1391 kg m−3. The best ﬁt elastic thickness of this geologically young deposit is 140 km, though any value greater than 102 km can ﬁt the observations. The best ﬁt density implies that about 55\% dry ice by volume could be sequestered in these deposits if they were completely dust free. Alternatively, if these deposits were completely free of solid CO2, the dust content would be constrained to lie between about 14 and 28\% by volume. The bulk thermal conductivity of the polar cap is not signiﬁcantly affected by these maximum allowable concentrations of dust. However, even if a moderate quantity of solid CO2 were present as horizontal layers, the bulk thermal conductivity of the polar cap would be signiﬁcantly reduced. Reasonable estimates of the present day heat ﬂow of Mars predict that dry ice beneath the thicker portions of the south polar cap would have melted. Depending on the quantity of solid CO2 in these deposits today, it is even possible that water ice could melt where the cap is thickest. If independent estimates for either the dust or CO2 content of the south polar cap could be obtained, and if radar sounding data could determine whether this polar cap is presently experiencing basal melting or not, it would be possible to use these observations to place tight constraints on the present day heat ﬂow of Mars.},

	abstract = {Magnetic field measurements show that Mars possesses strong crustal magnetic anomalies that formed when the planet had an active dynamo. To investigate the origin of this magnetization, we used localized power spectrum analyses to constrain the equivalent depths of thin magnetic layers in the crust. Using a new martian magnetic field model that incorporates data from both the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN and Mars Global Surveyor missions, we found that the equivalent magnetization depths on Mars vary from the surface to 72 km. In the northern hemisphere the magnetization depths are found to be on average 9 km, whereas in the southern hemisphere the depths are on average 32 km. If these depths are interpreted in terms of a thick magnetic layer, magnetization in the northern lowlands could extend from the surface to about 18 km depth, whereas for the southern highlands the magnetic layer could extend from about 20 km depth to the base of the crust. The strongest magnetic anomalies are, in general, associated with deep source depths. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis where strong primordial magnetic materials of the northern hemisphere were excavated from the Borealis impact basin, leaving only strong deep remanent magnetization in the southern hemisphere.},

We computed the accompanying density distribution and used it to calculate the mechanical and gravitational response of a spherical elastic shell overlying a quasi-hydrostatic mantle. We then compared the resulting geoid and surface deformation at degrees 2 and 4 with Mercury’s geoid and topography derived from the MErcury, Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft. More than 95\% of the data can be accounted for if the thickness of the elastic lithosphere were between 110 and 180 km when the thermal anomaly was imposed. The obtained elastic thickness implies that Mercury became locked into its present 3:2 spin orbit resonance later than about 1 Gyr after planetary formation.},

The inversion uses travel times of seismic waves originating from multiple meteoroid impact locations. Previous seismic investigations constrained the crustal thickness solely for Apollo stations 12, 14 and 16, whereas our approach enables to estimate the crustal thickness at locations far from the Apollo network, and to build a first crustal thickness map based on seismic data. Here we compare our crustal thickness estimates based on seismic travel times to those based on inversions of the topography and gravity field. Both methods turn out to be coherent in the sense that highland sites possess a thicker crust than mare sites.},

	abstract = {Magnetic ﬁeld data acquired from orbit shows that the Moon possesses many magnetic anomalies. Though most of these are not associated with known geologic structures, some are found within large impact basins within the interior peak ring. The primary magnetic carrier in lunar rocks is metallic iron, but indigenous lunar rocks are metal poor and cannot account easily for the observed ﬁeld strengths. The projectiles that formed the largest impact basins must have contained a signiﬁcant quantity of metallic iron, and a portion of this iron would have been retained on the Moon’s surface within the impact melt sheet. Here we use orbital magnetic ﬁeld data to invert for the magnetization within large impact basins using the assumption that the crust is unidirectionally magnetized. We develop a technique based on laboratory thermoremanent magnetization acquisition to quantify the relationship between the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld at the time the rock cooled and the abundance of metal in the rock. If we assume that the magnetized portion of the impact melt sheet is 1 km thick, we ﬁnd average abundances of metallic iron ranging from 0.11\% to 0.45 wt \%, with an uncertainty of a factor of about 3. This abundance is consistent with the metallic iron abundances in sampled lunar impact melts and the abundance of projectile contamination in terrestrial impact melts. These results help constrain the composition of the projectile, the impact process, and the time evolution of the lunar dynamo.},

	abstract = {Seismological constraints obtained from receiver function (RF) analysis provide important information about the crust and mantle structure. Here, we explore the utility of the free-surface multiple of the P-wave (PP) and the corresponding conversions in RF analysis. Using earthquake records, we demonstrate the efficacy of PPs-RFs before illustrating how they become especially useful when limited data is available in typical planetary missions. Using a transdimensional hierarchical Bayesian deconvolution approach, we compute robust P-to-S (Ps)- and PPs-RFs with InSight recordings of five marsquakes. Our Ps-RF results verify the direct Ps converted phases reported by previous RF analyses with increased coherence and reveal other phases including the primary multiple reverberating within the uppermost layer of the Martian crust. Unlike the Ps-RFs, our PPs-RFs lack an arrival at 7.2 s lag time. Whereas Ps-RFs on Mars could be equally well fit by a two- or three-layer crust, synthetic modeling shows that the disappearance of the 7.2 s phase requires a three-layer crust, and is highly sensitive to velocity and thickness of intra-crustal layers. We show that a three-layer crust is also preferred by S-to-P (Sp)RFs. While the deepest interface of the three-layer crust represents the crust-mantle interface beneath the InSight landing site, the other two interfaces at shallower depths could represent a sharp transition between either fractured and unfractured materials or thick basaltic flows and pre-existing crustal materials. PPs-RFs can provide complementary constraints and maximize the extraction of information about crustal structure in data-constrained circumstances such as planetary missions.},

	abstract = {Below the lithospheres of the terrestrial planets, dwarf planets, and moons, density interfaces adjust over geologic time to align with surfaces of constant gravitational potential. It is well known that the shape of such hydrostatic surfaces is controlled by the pseudo-rotational potential, tidal potential, and the induced potential of nonspherical density interfaces in the body. When a lithosphere is present, however, additional gravitational terms must be considered that arise from, for example, surface relief and crustal thickness variations. A first-order formalism is presented for calculating the shape of hydrostatic density interfaces beneath the lithosphere when the gravity field and surface shape of the body are known. Using an arbitrary discretized density profile, the shapes are obtained by solving a simple matrix equation. As examples, lithospheric gravity anomalies account for about 10\% of the relief along hydrostatic interfaces in Mars, whereas for the Moon, the lithospheric gravity is the dominant contributor to the core shape. Spherical harmonic degree-1 mass anomalies in the lithosphere generate degree-1 relief along the core-mantle boundary, and for Mars and the Moon, the core is offset from the center of mass of the body by about 90 m. The moments of inertia of the core of these bodies are also misaligned with respect to the principal moments of the entire body. An improved crustal thickness map of Mars is constructed that accounts for gravity anomalies beneath the lithosphere, and the consequences of core relief on the Martian free core nutation are quantified.},

The lunar GM, the product of the gravitational constant G and the mass M, is very well determined. However, uncertainties in the mass and mean density, 3345.56 ± 0.40 kg/m3, are limited by the accuracy of G. Values of the spherical harmonic degree-2 gravity coefﬁcients J2 and C22, as well as the Love number k2 describing lunar degree-2 elastic response to tidal forces, come from two independent analyses of the 3 month GRAIL Primary Mission data at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Goddard Space Flight Center. The two k2 determinations, with uncertainties of {\textasciitilde}1\%, differ by 1\%; the average value is 0.02416 ± 0.00022 at a 1 month period with reference radius R = 1738 km. Lunar laser ranging (LLR) data analysis determines (C À A)/B and (B À A)/C, where A {\textless} B {\textless} C are the principal moments of inertia; the ﬂattening of the ﬂuid outer core; the dissipation at its solid boundaries; and the monthly tidal dissipation Q = 37.5 ± 4. The moment of inertia computation combines the GRAIL-determined J2 and C22 with LLR-derived (C À A)/B and (B À A)/C. The normalized mean moment of inertia of the solid Moon is Is/MR2 = 0.392728 ± 0.000012. Matching the density, moment, and Love number, calculated models have a ﬂuid outer core with radius of 200–380 km, a solid inner core with radius of 0–280 km and mass fraction of 0–1\%, and a deep mantle zone of low seismic shear velocity.

          ,
            Observations from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission indicate a marked change in the gravitational signature of lunar impact structures at the morphological transition, with increasing diameter, from complex craters to peak-ring basins. At crater diameters larger than {\textasciitilde}200 km, a central positive Bouguer anomaly is seen within the innermost peak ring, and an annular negative Bouguer anomaly extends outward from this ring to the outer topographic rim crest. These observations demonstrate that basin-forming impacts remove crustal materials from within the peak ring and thicken the crust between the peak ring and the outer rim crest. A correlation between the diameter of the central Bouguer gravity high and the outer topographic ring diameter for well-preserved basins enables the identification and characterization of basins for which topographic signatures have been obscured by superposed cratering and volcanism. The GRAIL inventory of lunar basins improves upon earlier lists that differed in their totals by more than a factor of 2. The size-frequency distributions of basins on the nearside and farside hemispheres of the Moon differ substantially; the nearside hosts more basins larger than 350 km in diameter, whereas the farside has more smaller basins. Hemispherical differences in target properties, including temperature and porosity, are likely to have contributed to these different distributions. Better understanding of the factors that control basin size will help to constrain models of the original impactor population.},

The crustal thickness maps for the homogeneous model give plausible results, but this model is nor consistent with the seismic data, petrologi.c evidence, and geoid to topography ratios, all of which suggest some form of crustal stratification. Several dual-layered models were investigated, and it was found that only models with both upper and lower c rustal thickness variations could satisfy the gravity and topography data. These models predict that the entire upper crust has been excavat ed beneath the major nearside multiring b as itis. Additiona lly, significant amounts of lower crusta l material was excavated from these basins, especially beneath Crisium.

A new range of crustal density values is calculated from the major element chemistry of Martian meteorites (3100–3700 kg/m3), igneous rocks at Gusev crater (3100–3600 kg/m3) and from the surface concentration of Fe, Al, Ca, Si, and K measured by the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer on board Mars Odyssey (3250–3450 kg/m3). In addition, the density of mineral assemblages resulting from low-pressure crystallization of primary melts of the primitive mantle are estimated for plausible conditions of partial melting corresponding to the Noachian to Amazonian periods (3100–3300 kg/m3). Despite the diﬀerences between these approaches, the results are all consistent with an average density above 3100 kg/m3 for those materials that are close to the surface. The density may be compatible with the measured mass of Mars and the moment of inertia factor, but only if the average crustal thickness is thicker than previously thought (approaching 100 km). A thicker crust implies that crustal delamination and recycling could be possible and may even control its thickness, globally or locally. Alternatively, and considering that geoid-to-topography ratios argue against such a thick crust for the highlands, our results suggest the existence of a buried felsic or anorthositic component in the southern hemisphere of Mars.},

Icarus 156, 399–433]. After determining the planetary impact probabilities as a function of the relative encounter velocity and encounter inclination, the impact positions are calculated analytically, assuming the projectiles follow hyperbolic paths during the encounter phase. As the source of projectiles is not isotropic, latitudinal variations of the impact ﬂux are predicted: the calculated ratio between the pole and equator is 1.05 for Mercury, 1.00 for Venus, 0.96 for the Earth, 0.90 for the Moon, and 1.14 for Mars over its long-term obliquity variation history. By taking into account the latitudinal dependence of the impact velocity and impact angle, and by using a crater scaling law that depends on the vertical component of the impact velocity, the latitudinal variations of the cratering rate (the number of craters with a given size formed per unit time and unit area) is in general enhanced. With respect to the equator, the polar cratering rate is about 30\% larger on Mars and 10\% on Mercury, whereas it is 10\% less on the Earth and 20\% less on the Moon. The cratering rate is found to be uniform on Venus. The relative global impact ﬂuxes on Mercury, Venus, the Earth and Mars are calculated with respect to the Moon, and we ﬁnd values of 1.9, 1.8, 1.6, and 2.8, respectively. Our results show that the relative shape of the crater size-frequency distribution does not noticeably depend upon latitude for any of the terrestrial bodies in this study. Nevertheless, by neglecting the expected latitudinal variations of the cratering rate, systematic errors of 20–30\% in the age of planetary surfaces could exist between equatorial and polar regions when using the crater chronology method.},

	abstract = {We model the cratering of the Moon and terrestrial planets from the present knowledge of the orbital and size distribution of asteroids and comets in the inner Solar System, in order to reﬁne the crater chronology method. Impact occurrences, locations, velocities and incidence angles are calculated semi-analytically, and scaling laws are used to convert impactor sizes into crater sizes. Our approach is generalizable to other moons or planets. The lunar cratering rate varies with both latitude and longitude: with respect to the global average, it is about 25\% lower at (±65°N, 90°E) and larger by the same amount at the apex of motion (0°N, 90°W) for the present Earth–Moon separation. The measured size-frequency distributions of lunar craters are reconciled with the observed population of near-Earth objects under the assumption that craters smaller than a few kilometers in diameter form in a porous megaregolith. Varying depths of this megaregolith between the mare and highlands is a plausible partial explanation for differences in previously reported measured size-frequency distributions. We give a revised analytical relationship between the number of craters and the age of a lunar surface. For the inner planets, expected size-frequency crater distributions are calculated that account for differences in impact conditions, and the age of a few key geologic units is given. We estimate the Orientale and Caloris basins to be 3.73 Ga old, and the surface of Venus to be 240 Ma old. The terrestrial cratering record is consistent with the revised chronology and a constant impact rate over the last 400 Ma. Better knowledge of the orbital dynamics, crater scaling laws and megaregolith properties are needed to conﬁdently assess the net uncertainty of the model ages that result from the combination of numerous steps, from the observation of asteroids to the formation of craters. Our model may be inaccurate for periods prior to 3.5 Ga because of a different impactor population, or for craters smaller than a few kilometers on Mars and Mercury, due to the presence of subsurface ice and to the abundance of large secondaries, respectively. Standard parameter values allow for the ﬁrst time to naturally reproduce both the size distribution and absolute number of lunar craters up to 3.5 Ga ago, and give self-consistent estimates of the planetary cratering rates relative to the Moon.},

            High-resolution gravity data obtained from the dual Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft show that the bulk density of the Moon's highlands crust is 2550 kilograms per cubic meter, substantially lower than generally assumed. When combined with remote sensing and sample data, this density implies an average crustal porosity of 12\% to depths of at least a few kilometers. Lateral variations in crustal porosity correlate with the largest impact basins, whereas lateral variations in crustal density correlate with crustal composition. The low-bulk crustal density allows construction of a global crustal thickness model that satisfies the Apollo seismic constraints, and with an average crustal thickness between 34 and 43 kilometers, the bulk refractory element composition of the Moon is not required to be enriched with respect to that of Earth.},

	abstract = {The flexure of the lithosphere under stresses imposed by the geologically young south polar cap is one of the few clues we have regarding the south polar cap composition and the present-day thermal state of Mars. Here, we combine radar, gravity, and topography data with a flexural loading model to estimate the bulk density () and average real dielectric constant ( ) of the south polar cap, and the elastic thickness of the lithosphere (Te). Given the uncertainties of the data, our results constrain  to be 1,100–1,300 kg m3 (best fit of 1,220 kg m3),   to be 2.5–3.4 (best fit of 3.3), and Te to be greater than 150 km (best fit of 360 km). Based on these results, the maximum lithospheric flexure is 770 m, and the polar cap volume could be up to 26\% larger than previous estimates that did not account for lithospheric flexure. Our inferred compositions imply that the dust concentration would be at least 9 vol\% if the CO2 ice content were negligible, and that the CO2 ice concentration would be more than the known 1 vol\% CO2 if the dust concentration were less than 9 vol\%. The 1- lower limit on Te implies a surface heat flow that is less than 23.5 mW m2. This lower limit is significantly less than the range of acceptable values at the north pole (330–450 km, heat flow of 11–16 mW m2), and helps satisfy global thermal evolution simulations that predict hemispheric differences in surface heat flow.},

We correlate the depths of origin of materials that make up central peaks with a geophysically derived dual-layered crustal thickness model and ﬁnd that the peak compositions are consistent with this stratiﬁed model. Speciﬁcally, peaks composed exclusively of rocks containing more than 85\% plagioclase (by volume) come from this model’s upper crust, whereas peaks that contain some norite or gabbro-norite come from the model’s lower crust. Extrapolating these data we ﬁnd that the Moon’s upper crust is composed of 88±4\% plagioclase, corresponding to 29 to 32 wt.\% Al2O3. The most-maﬁc lower portion of the crust is composed of 65±8\% plagioclase, having an Al2O3 content that lies between 18 and 25 wt.\%. We show that the lower portion of the crust is consistent with having formed by cumulate ﬂotation in a lunar magma ocean.},

	abstract = {Orbital magnetic ﬁeld data show that portions of the Moon’s crust are strongly magnetized, and paleomagnetic data of lunar samples suggest that Earth strength magnetic ﬁelds could have existed during the ﬁrst several hundred million years of lunar history. The origin of the ﬁelds that magnetized the crust are not understood and could be the result of either a long-lived core-generated dynamo or transient ﬁelds associated with large impact events. Core dynamo models usually predict that the ﬁeld would be predominantly dipolar, with the dipole axis aligned with the rotation axis. We test this hypothesis by modeling the direction of crustal magnetization using a global magnetic ﬁeld model of the Moon derived from Lunar Prospector and Kaguya magnetometer data. We make use of a model that assumes that the crust is unidirectionally magnetized. The intensity of magnetization can vary with the crust, and the best ﬁtting direction of magnetization is obtained from a nonnegative least squares inversion. From the best ﬁtting magnetization direction we obtain the corresponding north magnetic pole predicted by an internal dipolar ﬁeld. Some of the obtained paleopoles are associated with the current geographic poles, while other well-constrained anomalies have paleopoles at equatorial latitudes, preferentially at 90∘ east and west longitudes. One plausible hypothesis for this distribution of paleopoles is that the Moon possessed a long-lived dipolar ﬁeld but that the dipole was not aligned with the rotation axis as a result of large-scale heat ﬂow heterogeneities at the core-mantle boundary.},

              used recently detected marsquakes from the seismometer deployed during the InSight mission to map the interior of Mars (see the Perspective by Cottaar and Koelemeijer). Mars likely has a 24- to 72-kilometer-thick crust with a very deep lithosphere close to 500 kilometers. Similar to the Earth, a low-velocity layer probably exists beneath the lithosphere. The crust of Mars is likely highly enriched in radioactive elements that help to heat this layer at the expense of the interior. The core of Mars is liquid and large, ∼1830 kilometers, which means that the mantle has only one rocky layer rather than two like the Earth has. These results provide a preliminary structure of Mars that helps to constrain the different theories explaining the chemistry and internal dynamics of the planet.

            Data from the InSight mission on Mars help constrain the structure and properties of the martian mantle.
          ,
            A planet’s crust bears witness to the history of planetary formation and evolution, but for Mars, no absolute measurement of crustal thickness has been available. Here, we determine the structure of the crust beneath the InSight landing site on Mars using both marsquake recordings and the ambient wavefield. By analyzing seismic phases that are reflected and converted at subsurface interfaces, we find that the observations are consistent with models with at least two and possibly three interfaces. If the second interface is the boundary of the crust, the thickness is 20 ± 5 kilometers, whereas if the third interface is the boundary, the thickness is 39 ± 8 kilometers. Global maps of gravity and topography allow extrapolation of this point measurement to the whole planet, showing that the average thickness of the martian crust lies between 24 and 72 kilometers. Independent bulk composition and geodynamic constraints show that the thicker model is consistent with the abundances of crustal heat-producing elements observed for the shallow surface, whereas the thinner model requires greater concentration at depth.},

	abstract = {The tilt angle of the 18.6 year precession of the Moon’s solid inner core is unknown, but it is set by a balance between gravitational and pressure torques acting on its elliptical ﬁgure. We show here that to ﬁrst order, the angle of precession of the inner core of a planetary body is determined by the frequency of the free inner core nutation, 𝜔ﬁcn, relative to the precession frequency, Ωp. If {\textbar}𝜔ﬁcn{\textbar} ≪ {\textbar}Ωp{\textbar}, the inner core is blind to the gravitational inﬂuence of the mantle. If {\textbar}𝜔ﬁcn{\textbar} ≫ {\textbar}Ωp{\textbar}, the inner core is gravitationally locked to the mantle and is nearly aligned with it. If 𝜔ﬁcn ≈ Ωp, large inner core tilt angles can result from resonant excitation. Viscous inner core relaxation and electromagnetic coupling can attenuate large tilt angles. For the speciﬁc case of the Moon, we show that 𝜔ﬁcn is to within a factor of 2 of Ωp = 2𝜋∕18.6 yr−1. For a rigid inner core, this implies a tilt of 2 to 5∘ with respect to the mantle, and larger if 𝜔ﬁcn is very close to Ωp. More modest tilt angles between 0 and 0.5∘ result if viscous relaxation within the inner core occurs on a timescale of one lunar day. Predictions from our model may be used in an attempt to detect the gravity signal resulting from a tilted inner core, to determine the past history of the inner core tilt angle, and to assess models of dynamo generation powered by diﬀerential rotation at the core-mantle and inner core boundaries.},

The employed admittance model considers loading of an initially spherical surface, and surface as well as subsurface loading is taken into account. Our results indicate that the gravity and topography data available at Tyrrhena Patera is consistent with the absence of subsurface loading, but the presence of a small subsurface load cannot be ruled out. We obtain minimum load densities of 2960 kg mÀ3, minimum load thicknesses of 5 km, and minimum load volumes of 0.6 Â 106 km3. Photogeological evidence suggests that pyroclastic deposits make up at most 30\% of this volume, such that the bulk of Tyrrhena Patera is likely composed of competent basalt. Best ﬁtting model parameters are a load density of 3343 kg mÀ3, a load thickness of 10.8 km, and a load volume of 1.7 Â 106 km3. These relatively large load densities indicate that lava compositions are comparable to those at other martian volcanoes, and densities are comparable to those of the martian meteorites. The elastic thickness in the region is constrained to be smaller than 27.5 km at the time of loading, indicating surface heat ﬂows in excess of 24 mW mÀ2.},

The magnetic eﬃciency (the ratio of thermoremanent magnetization to saturation remanent magnetization) multiplied by the saturation magnetization is proportional to the magnetizing ﬁeld, where the proportionality constant is independent of magnetic mineralogy and domain state. The empirical constant for this equation was determined using existing experimental data of single domain through pseudosingle domain to multidomain states of iron, meteoritic iron, magnetite, maghemite, pyrrhotite, and hematite. We show that the acquired magnetic eﬃciency is closely related to two types of demagnetizing ﬁelds that act as barriers against domain wall pinning during magnetic acquisition. The ﬁrst relates to the saturation magnetization that is derived from the distribution of Bohr magnetons within the crystal lattice, and the second originates from grain shape. Theoretical considerations imply a factor of two diﬀerence in the magnetic eﬃciency acquired during laboratory and geologic timescales. This equation reveals that troilite may be a potentially important magnetic carrier for extraterrestrial magnetism. Using magnetic scanning techniques, our relationship allows for estimating the paleointensity from samples that contain more than one magnetic species.},

We fit the theoretical gravitational signal to observations in order to place constraints on 18 volcanic structures. Inverted parameters include the bulk density of the load, the elastic thickness required to support the volcanic edifice at the time it was emplaced (Te), the heat flow, the volume of extruded lava, and the ratio of volcanic products that form within (Vi) and above the preexisting surface (Ve). The bulk density of the volcanic structures is found to have a mean value of 3, 206 ± 190 kg/m3, which is representative of iron-rich basalts as sampled by the Martian basaltic meteorites. Te beneath the small volcanoes is found to be small, less than 15 km, which implies that the lithosphere was weak and hot when these volcanoes formed. Conversely, most large volcanoes display higher values of Te, which is consistent with the bulk of their emplacement occurring later in geologic history, when the elastic lithosphere was colder and thicker. Our estimates for the volumes of volcanic edifices are about 10 times larger than those that neglect the flexure of the lithosphere. Constraints on the magnitude of subsurface loads imply that the ratio Vi∕Ve is generally 3:5, which is smaller than for the Hawaiian volcanoes on Earth.},

	abstract = {We develop a method to estimate the power spectrum of a stochastic process on the sphere from data of limited geographical coverage. Our approach can be interpreted either as estimating the global power spectrum of a stationary process when only a portion of the data are available for analysis, or estimating the power spectrum from local data under the assumption that the data are locally stationary in a speciﬁed region. Restricting a global function to a spatial subdomain — whether by necessity or by design — is a windowing operation, and an equation like a convolution in the spectral domain relates the expected value of the windowed power spectrum to the underlying global power spectrum and the known power spectrum of the localization window. The best windows for the purpose of localized spectral analysis have their energy concentrated in the region of interest while possessing the smallest effective bandwidth as possible. Solving an optimization problem in the sense of Slepian (1960) yields a family of orthogonal windows of diminishing spatiospectral localization, the best concentrated of which we propose to use to form a weighted multitaper spectrum estimate in the sense of Thomson (1982). Such an estimate is both more representative of the target region and reduces the estimation variance when compared to estimates formed by any single bandlimited window. We describe how the weights applied to the individual spectral estimates in forming the multitaper estimate can be chosen such that the variance of the estimate is minimized.},

	abstract = {It is often advantageous to investigate the relationship between two geophysical data sets in the spectral domain by calculating admittance and coherence functions. While there exist powerful Cartesian windowing techniques to estimate spatially localized (cross-)spectral properties, the inherent sphericity of planetary bodies sometimes necessitates an approach based in spherical coordinates. Direct localized spectral estimates on the sphere can be obtained by tapering, or multiplying the data by a suitable windowing function, and expanding the resultant ﬁeld in spherical harmonics. The localization of a window in space and its spectral bandlimitation jointly determine the quality of the spatiospectral estimation. Two kinds of axisymmetric windows are here constructed that are ideally suited to this purpose: bandlimited functions that maximize their spatial energy within a cap of angular radius θ 0, and spacelimited functions that maximize their spectral power within a spherical harmonic bandwidth L. Both concentration criteria yield an eigenvalue problem that is solved by an orthogonal family of data tapers, and the properties of these windows depend almost entirely upon the space–bandwidth product N 0 = (L + 1) θ 0/π . The ﬁrst N 0 − 1 windows are near perfectly concentrated, and the bestconcentrated window approaches a lower bound imposed by a spherical uncertainty principle. In order to make robust localized estimates of the admittance and coherence spectra between two ﬁelds on the sphere, we propose a method analogous to Cartesian multitaper spectral analysis that uses our optimally concentrated data tapers. We show that the expectation of localized (cross-)power spectra calculated using our data tapers is nearly unbiased for stochastic processes when the input spectrum is white and when averages are made over all possible realizations of the random variables. In physical situations, only one realization of such a process will be available, but in this case, a weighted average of the spectra obtained using multiple data tapers well approximates the expected spectrum. While developed primarily to solve problems in planetary science, our method has applications in all areas of science that investigate spatiospectral relationships between data ﬁelds deﬁned on a sphere.},

	abstract = {Geophysical analyses are often performed in spherical geometry and require the use of spherical harmonic functions to express observables or physical quantities. When expanded to high degree, the accuracy and speed of the spherical harmonic transforms and reconstructions are of paramount importance. SHTools is a time and user-tested open-source archive of both Fortran 95 and Python routines for performing spherical harmonic analyses. The routines support all spherical-harmonic normalization conventions used in the geosciences, including 4p-normalized, Schmidt seminormalized, orthonormalized, and unnormalized harmonics, along with the option of employing the Condon-Shortley phase factor of ð21Þm. Data on the sphere can be sampled on a variety of grid formats, including equally spaced cylindrical grids and grids appropriate for integration by Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The spherical-harmonic transforms are proven to be fast and accurate for spherical harmonic degrees up to 2800. Several tools are provided for the geoscientist, including routines for performing localized spectral analyses and basic operations related to global gravity and magnetic ﬁelds. In the Python environment, operations are very simple to perform as a result of three class structures that encompass all operations on grids, spherical harmonic coefﬁcients, and spatiospectral localization windows.

Routine operations will be split into two services, the Mars Structure Service (MSS) and Marsquake Service (MQS), which will be responsible, respectively, for defining the structure models and seismicity catalogs from the mission. The MSS will deliver a series of products before the landing, during the operations, and finally to the Planetary Data System (PDS) archive. Prior to the mission, we assembled a suite of a priori models of Mars, based on estimates of bulk composition and thermal profiles. Initial models during the mission will rely on modeling surface waves and impact-generated body waves independent of prior knowledge of structure. Later modeling will include simultaneous inversion of seismic observations for source and structural parameters. We use Bayesian inversion techniques to obtain robust probability distribution functions of interior structure parameters. Shallow structure will be characterized using the hammering of the heatflow probe mole, as well as measurements of surface wave ellipticity. Crustal scale structure will be constrained by measurements of receiver function and broadband Rayleigh wave ellipticity measurements. Core interacting body wave phases should be observable above modeled martian noise levels, allowing us to constrain deep structure. Normal modes of Mars should also be observable and can be used to estimate the globally averaged 1D structure, while combination with results from the InSight radio science mission and orbital observations will allow for constraint of deeper structure.},

	abstract = {Analyses of lunar rocks and magnetic field data from orbit show that the Moon once had a global magnetic field generated by an internal dynamo. Magnetization of the deep crust implies that a dynamo operated during the first 100 million years following crust formation and magnetization of some impact basins implies that the dynamo continued into the Nectarian period. Paleomagnetic analyses of Apollo samples provide evidence for dynamo activity from about 4.25 billion years ago (Ga) until at least 1.92 Ga, ceasing thereafter by {\textasciitilde}0.80 Ga. The field strength was Earth-like until about 3.56 Ga (from {\textasciitilde}40 to 110 μT), after which it decreased by more than an order of magnitude. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the long duration of the lunar dynamo. These include thermal convection in the core that could power a dynamo for a few hundred million years, core crystallization that could power a dynamo until about 1.5 Ga, mantle and/or inner core precession that could power a dynamo beyond 2 Ga, impact-induced changes in the rotation rate of the mantle that could power several short-lived dynamos up until when the last basin formed at {\textasciitilde}3.7 Ga, and a basal magma ocean that could have potentially powered a dynamo over much of lunar history. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations have shown that the amplification of pre-existing fields by impact generated plasmas are insufficient and too short lived to have played an important role in crustal magnetization. Some of the magnetic carriers responsible for crustal magnetization, such as those responsible for the magnetization of the deep highland crust and mare basalts, are of lunar origin. Other magnetic carriers may instead be derived from meteoritic materials that were accreted to the Moon during large impacts. Outstanding questions in lunar magnetism include the geometry of the internally generated magnetic field, the exceedingly high surface field strengths implied by some paleomagnetic analyses, whether dynamo activity was continuous or episodic, the origin of strong crustal magnetic anomalies that have no correlation with surface geology, and the mechanisms that powered the lunar dynamo through time.},

	abstract = {Geodetic and geophysical investigations of the Galilean moon Callisto address fundamental questions regarding the formation and evolution of the Jovian system. Callisto's evolution and internal structure appear to significantly differ from the other Jovian satellites. Similarly-sized Ganymede is a highly evolved ice-rock moon with a differentiated interior, intrinsic magnetic field, and abundant surface evidence of internal activity. In contrast, Callisto's surface is ancient, and Galileo spacecraft data suggest its interior is only incompletely differentiated, despite the presumed presence of a sub-surface ocean. These properties make Callisto uniquely able to constrain the timing and nature of the Jovian system formation. The Magnetics, Altimetry, Gravity, and Imaging of Callisto (MAGIC) mission concept is conceived to fully characterize the properties of this enigmatic moon from its deep interior to the icy shell. Three main instruments are included as a scientific payload. Highly accurate measurements of Callisto's topography, magnetic field, and morphology are obtained by the onboard laser altimeter, magnetometer, and camera, respectively. The telecommunication system supports an additional gravity and radio science investigation. Long- and short-wavelength gravity anomalies afford powerful constraints on internal differentiation and the properties of the hydrosphere (water and ice). Comprehensive numerical simulations and covariance analyses of MAGIC mission scenarios presented in this paper show that the gravitational degree-2 normalized coefficients and the pole obliquity enable the determination of the moment of inertia with an accuracy better than 0.015\%. The combination of gravity and altimetry measurements acquired by MAGIC are essential to the characterization of Callisto's interior if - as is likely - the degree-2 gravity includes non-hydrostatic terms. MAGIC's radio science data yield the estimation of Callisto's gravity field with spatial resolutions of {\textless}100 km. The combination of gravitational and deformation tides that are retrieved by the radio science and altimetry investigations, respectively, leads to the recovery of the rigid ice shell thickness to within similar to 3 km. Together these datasets would resolve ambiguities inherent in Galileo flyby data, revealing Callisto's interior structure as well as the existence and properties of its postulated internal ocean.},

	abstract = {The third stage of the Saturn IV rocket used in the five Apollo missions made craters on the Moon similar to 30 m in diameter. Their initial impact conditions were known, so they can be considered controlled impacts. Here, we used the iSALE-2D shock physics code to numerically simulate the formation of these craters, and to calculate the vertical component of seismic moment (similar to 4 x 10(10) Nm) and seismic efficiency (similar to 10(-6)) associated with these impacts. The irregular booster shape likely caused the irregular crater morphology observed. To investigate this, we modeled six projectile geometries, with footprint area between 3 and 105 m(2), keeping the mass and velocity of the impactor constant. We showed that the crater depth and diameter decreased as the footprint area increased. The central mound observed in lunar impact sites could be a result of layering of the target and/or low density of the projectile. Understanding seismic signatures from impact events is important for planetary seismology. Calculating seismic parameters and validating them against controlled experiments in a planetary setting will help us understand the seismic data received, not only from the Moon, but also from the InSight Mission on Mars and future seismic missions. Plain Language Summary Observations of meteoroid strikes on the Moon, including artificial impacts made by the Saturn boosters from the Apollo missions, present valuable information for connecting impact conditions with seismic properties of the lunar and planetary crusts. These artificial impacts on the Moon were made by irregularly shaped spacecraft with low density. We numerically simulated these artificial impacts, using several different projectile geometries in order to represent the spacecraft's low density and shape. We found that the projectile representation affected the crater size. We calculated the amount of energy transferred into seismic waves and seismic moment created in these impacts to be consistent with previous studies. These parameters did not change with different projectile representations, but were affected by the material properties of the impact site. The aim is to use the results from the controlled lunar impacts to help understand the seismic signatures of impacts on Mars.},

	abstract = {Seismological constraints obtained from receiver function (RF) analysis provide important information about the crust and mantle structure. Here, we explore the utility of the free-surface multiple of the P-wave (PP) and the corresponding conversions in RF analysis. Using earthquake records, we demonstrate the efficacy of PPs-RFs before illustrating how they become especially useful when limited data is available in typical planetary missions. Using a transdimensional hierarchical Bayesian deconvolution approach, we compute robust P-to-S (Ps)- and PPs-RFs with InSight recordings of five marsquakes. Our Ps-RF results verify the direct Ps converted phases reported by previous RF analyses with increased coherence and reveal other phases including the primary multiple reverberating within the uppermost layer of the Martian crust. Unlike the Ps-RFs, our PPs-RFs lack an arrival at 7.2 s lag time. Whereas Ps-RFs on Mars could be equally well fit by a two- or three-layer crust, synthetic modeling shows that the disappearance of the 7.2 s phase requires a three-layer crust, and is highly sensitive to velocity and thickness of intra-crustal layers. We show that a three-layer crust is also preferred by S-to-P (Sp)-RFs. While the deepest interface of the three-layer crust represents the crust-mantle interface beneath the InSight landing site, the other two interfaces at shallower depths could represent a sharp transition between either fractured and unfractured materials or thick basaltic flows and pre-existing crustal materials. PPs-RFs can provide complementary constraints and maximize the extraction of information about crustal structure in data-constrained circumstances such as planetary missions.},
